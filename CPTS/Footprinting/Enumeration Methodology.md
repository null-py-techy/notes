This methodology is nested in 6 layers and represents, metaphorically speaking, boundaries that we try to pass with the enumeration process. The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

It includes OS setup, privileges, processes, accessible services, gateway, and internet presence, with detailed subcategories like OS type, network config, users, tasks, service type, firewalls, and domains.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/enum-method33.png)

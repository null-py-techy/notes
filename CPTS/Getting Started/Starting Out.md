#### Vulnerable Machines/Applications

There are many resources available to practice common web and network vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled setting. The following are some examples of purposefully vulnerable web applications and vulnerable machines that we can set up in a lab environment for extra practice.


| [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)                                 | Is a modern vulnerable web application written in Node.js, Express, and Angular which showcases the entire [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other real-world application security flaws. |

| [Metasploitable 2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2-exploitability-guide/) | Is a purposefully vulnerable Ubuntu Linux VM that can be used to practice enumeration, automated, and manual exploitation.                                                                                                     |
| [Metasploitable 3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3)                                 | \|Is a template for building a vulnerable Windows VM configured with a wide range of [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/wiki/Vulnerabilities).<br>                                                    |
| [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)                                                     | This is a vulnerable PHP/MySQL web application showcasing many common web application vulnerabilities with varying degrees of difficulty.                                                                                      |

#### YouTube Channels

There are many YouTube channels out there that showcase penetration testing/hacking techniques. A few worth bookmarking are:

|
|[IppSec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA)|Provides an extremely in-depth walkthrough of every retired HTB box packed full of insight from his own experience, as well as videos on various techniques.|
|[VbScrub](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpoyhjwNIWZmsiKNKpsMAQQ)|Provides HTB videos as well as videos on techniques, primarily focusing on Active Directory exploitation.|
|[STÖK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQN2DsjnYH60SFBIA6IkNwg)|Provides videos on various infosec related topics, mainly focusing on bug bounties and web application penetration testing.|
|[LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)|Provides videos on a wide variety of technical infosec topics.|

#### Beginner Friendly HTB Machines

There are many beginner-friendly machines on the main HTB platform. Some recommended ones are:

| [Lame](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/1) | [Blue](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/51) | [Nibbles](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/121) | [Shocker](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/108) | [Jerry](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/144) |

#### Beginner Friendly HTB Challenges

The HTB platform contains one-off challenges in a variety of categories. Some beginner-friendly challenges include:

|[Find The Easy Pass](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/5)|[Weak RSA](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/6)|[You know 0xDiablos](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/106)|

#### Dante Prolab

The HTB platform has various Pro Labs that are simulated enterprise networks with many interconnected hosts that players can use to practice their skills in a network containing multiple targets.  
Successful exploitation of specific hosts will yield information that will help players when attacking hosts encountered later in the lab.

The [Dante Pro Lab](https://app.hackthebox.com/prolabs/overview/dante) is the most beginner-friendly lab offered to date. This lab is geared towards players with some experience performing network and web application attacks and an understanding of networking concepts and the basics of penetration methodologies such as scanning/enumeration, lateral movement, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, etc.
